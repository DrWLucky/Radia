Xcode 2.2 creates the libXOPSupport.a file in the build/Debug directory
(or build/Release if you build the release configuration).

Previous versions of Xcode created it in the project directory (the parent of build).
Consequently, existing XOP projects look for it in the project directory. Thus,
after rebuilding the library, you must move the libXOPSupport.a file from the
Debug (or Release) directory to the project directory.
